# A Little About Me

*Hi there!*

I'm James Ma, and I'm currently a rising fourth year undergraduate student at UCLA
studying Computer Science. Aside from coding I enjoy playing basketball, working out, 
watching anime, eating food, cooking food, collecting credit cards, and risky financial
investments (i.e. crypto).

As of July 2022, I'm fully currently hard at work at AWS, where I'm building a service
to orchestrate the delivery of drive firmware to all AWS servers.


# A Little About this Website
I decided to learn some React because I had nothing to do while I was quarantined during 
the summer of 2020. The result is this personal website I've built for fun.

This website will mostly be a place for me to show off some of the projects
I've made over the years. I added a blog in too. I'll ~~probably~~
hopefully keep it updated often.
